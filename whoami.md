My name is Devid,

My core skill set involves emulating real-world cyber attacks through Adversary Simulation and Red Team exercises.

Throughout my experience in the offensive security field, I have participated in and managed several engagements targeting banks, insurance companies, critical infrastructures, and various other businesses.

My primary interest lies in synthesizing and researching new techniques employed by attackers, aiming to enhance the security posture of the companies I work with.
